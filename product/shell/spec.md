# Application Shell Specification

## Overview
MOZE Finance uses a minimal header shell that stays out of the way of the scroll-driven storytelling experience. The header provides quick brand recognition and persistent access to the primary conversion action without disrupting the immersive landing page flow.

## Navigation Structure
- MOZE logo (left side) - links to top of page
- Primary CTA button (right side) - "Plan een gesprek met MoMo"

## Layout Pattern
Minimal fixed header with clean white background, subtle bottom border for depth separation. The header spans full width and sits above all content with a subtle backdrop blur effect for premium feel.

## Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop:** Full header with logo (left) and CTA button (right), generous padding
- **Tablet:** Same layout, slightly reduced padding
- **Mobile:** Logo scales down, CTA button remains visible but more compact, reduced padding for space efficiency

## Design Notes
- Header uses fixed positioning to remain accessible during scroll
- Applies sky-500 primary color to CTA button with hover glow effect
- Logo should be simple and minimal (text-based or SVG)
- CTA button uses Space Grotesk font for consistency with hero typography
- Subtle shadow/blur backdrop for premium separation from content
- Optional: header can hide on scroll down, reveal on scroll up for maximum content space
