# MOZE Finance

## Description
A bold, design-forward Next.js landing page for MOZE Finance that converts design/tech-conscious entrepreneurs through kinetic typography, GSAP scroll-triggered sequences, and Framer Motion micro-interactions. The site positions MOZE as a modern financial partner with clean white backgrounds and strategic animation, driving the primary conversion goal: "Plan een gesprek met MoMo."

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Generic accounting websites are visually boring and fail to engage modern entrepreneurs
MOZE Finance uses kinetic typography (GSAP text splitting), abstract 3D shapes, vibrant gradients (#48A9FF blue, #FF5F6D coral), and heavily customized shadcn/ui components on a clean white background to create a premium, standout experience.

### Problem 2: Traditional accounting sites bury conversion goals in cluttered layouts
The landing page prioritizes conversion with strategic CTA placement ("Plan een gesprek met MoMo"), scroll-driven storytelling (Hero → Probleem → Oplossing → Social Proof → Differentiatie → FAQ → Final CTA), and minimal friction to booking.

### Problem 3: Entrepreneurs face spreadsheet chaos, deadline stress, and compliance anxiety
The page communicates MOZE's end-to-end automation, proactive advice, and "Operationeel binnen 14 dagen" promise through clear Dutch copy, trust signals (Bekroond accountant, AVG-compliant), and social proof that speaks to pain points like "Bonnetjes in een schoenendoos. Deadlines in je achterhoofd."

### Problem 4: Stock photos and muted palettes make financial services feel impersonal
Custom abstract visuals, gradient blobs, floating data cards, and a distinctive color system create a premium, human-yet-innovative brand presence with the tagline "Perfecte cijfers. Zonder de grijze pakken."
