# Raw Idea: MOZE Finance Landing Page v2

## Feature Description

Add Payload CMS for content management so the accountant can edit text and images. Enhance the landing page with animated shadcn components from Aceternity, MagicUI, Motion Primitives, Animate-UI, and SmoothUI registries. Create in src-v2/ directory to keep v1 intact.

## Key Points

- **CMS Integration**: Payload CMS for content management
- **Target User**: Accountant (non-technical user who needs to edit text and images)
- **Animation Libraries**: Aceternity, MagicUI, Motion Primitives, Animate-UI, SmoothUI
- **Directory**: src-v2/ (preserves existing v1 implementation)

## Context

This is a v2 iteration of the MOZE Finance landing page. The original implementation exists in the src/ directory and should remain untouched. The new version will be built in src-v2/ with enhanced animations and content management capabilities for non-technical users.
