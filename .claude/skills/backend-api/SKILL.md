name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following best practices for resource-based URLs, HTTP methods, and status codes. Use this skill when creating or modifying API endpoints, routes, controllers, or handlers in backend files. Use when working with REST API design, implementing CRUD operations, defining API versioning strategies, setting up query parameters for filtering/pagination, configuring rate limiting, or establishing endpoint naming conventions. Apply when editing route definition files, API controller classes, endpoint handler functions, or API documentation.

# Backend API

## When to use this skill

- When creating new API endpoints or routes in your backend application
- When modifying existing REST API controllers or handlers
- When implementing CRUD operations for resources
- When designing URL structures and endpoint naming conventions
- When working with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and status codes
- When setting up API versioning (URL path or header-based)
- When implementing query parameters for filtering, sorting, or pagination
- When configuring rate limiting or API throttling
- When editing route definition files (e.g., routes.js, api.py, routes.rb)
- When working on API controller or handler files

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.
