name: Global Validation
description: Implement comprehensive input validation with server-side checks, client-side UX feedback, fail-fast approaches, specific error messages, allowlists, and sanitization to prevent injection attacks. Use this skill when validating user input, form data, API requests, query parameters, or business rules. Apply when working with validation logic in controllers, form handlers, API endpoints, data models, or any code that accepts external input requiring verification.

# Global Validation

## When to use this skill

- When validating user input from forms or API requests
- When implementing server-side validation logic
- When adding client-side validation for better user experience
- When checking data types, formats, ranges, and required fields
- When validating business rules (e.g., sufficient balance, valid dates)
- When sanitizing input to prevent SQL injection, XSS, or command injection
- When using allowlists to define acceptable input values
- When providing specific, field-level error messages to users
- When validating at all entry points (web forms, API endpoints, background jobs)
- When working with form handlers, API controllers, or data processing code
- When implementing fail-fast validation that rejects invalid data early
- When duplicating client-side validation checks on the server

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global validation.
