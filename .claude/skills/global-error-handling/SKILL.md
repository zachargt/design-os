name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, fail-fast validation, specific exception types, centralized error boundaries, graceful degradation, and proper resource cleanup. Use this skill when implementing try-catch blocks, handling exceptions, validating user input, managing API errors, implementing retry logic, or setting up error boundaries. Apply when working with error handling code in any language, exception classes, validation logic, API error responses, or resource cleanup patterns.

# Global Error Handling

## When to use this skill

- When implementing try-catch blocks or exception handling
- When validating user input or checking preconditions
- When handling errors from API calls or external services
- When creating user-friendly error messages
- When implementing specific exception or error types
- When setting up centralized error handling at application boundaries
- When designing systems to degrade gracefully on failures
- When implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff
- When cleaning up resources in finally blocks or equivalent
- When handling errors in controllers, API layers, or service boundaries
- When working with error handling code in any file type
- When preventing exposure of technical details or security information in errors

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global error handling.
