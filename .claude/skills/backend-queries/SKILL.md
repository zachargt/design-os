name: Backend Queries
description: Write secure, performant database queries using parameterized statements, eager loading to prevent N+1 queries, strategic indexing, and appropriate use of transactions. Use this skill when writing database queries, implementing data fetching logic, optimizing query performance, preventing SQL injection, using ORM query builders, or managing database transactions. Apply when working with query files, repository patterns, data access layers, SQL statements, or any code that retrieves or manipulates database data.

# Backend Queries

## When to use this skill

- When writing new database queries or modifying existing ones
- When implementing data fetching logic in services or repositories
- When using ORM query builders or raw SQL
- When optimizing query performance to prevent N+1 queries
- When implementing eager loading or joins for related data
- When selecting specific columns instead of using SELECT *
- When adding WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses that need indexing
- When wrapping related database operations in transactions
- When implementing query timeouts to prevent runaway queries
- When caching expensive or frequently-run queries
- When working with query files, repository classes, or data access objects
- When preventing SQL injection by using parameterized queries

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.
