name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write focused, behavior-oriented tests for core user flows with clear test names, mocked dependencies, and fast execution while deferring comprehensive edge case coverage until explicitly required. Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests for critical functionality. Apply when working with test files, test frameworks (Jest, RSpec, pytest), mocking external dependencies, or testing primary user workflows and business-critical paths.

# Testing Test Writing

## When to use this skill

- When writing tests for core user workflows and critical functionality
- When creating unit tests for new features at logical completion points
- When testing primary user flows and business-critical paths
- When writing clear, descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- When ensuring tests run fast (milliseconds for unit tests)
- When testing behavior rather than implementation details
- When working with test files (*.test.js, *_spec.rb, test_*.py, *.spec.ts)
- When setting up test frameworks or configuring test runners
- When writing minimal tests during development, not for every intermediate step
- When deferring edge case and error state testing unless business-critical

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.
