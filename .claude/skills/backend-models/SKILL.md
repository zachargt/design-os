name: Backend Models
description: Define database models with clear naming, appropriate data types, timestamps, constraints, and relationship mappings following ORM best practices. Use this skill when creating or modifying database model classes, defining table schemas, setting up model relationships, configuring data validation, or implementing model-level business logic. Apply when working with ORM model files, ActiveRecord classes, Sequelize models, Prisma schemas, SQLAlchemy models, or any database entity definitions that map to tables.

# Backend Models

## When to use this skill

- When creating new database model or entity classes
- When modifying existing model definitions or schemas
- When defining table structures and column data types
- When setting up model relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.)
- When adding timestamps (created_at, updated_at) to models
- When implementing database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys)
- When configuring cascade behaviors for relationships
- When adding validation rules at the model level
- When working with ORM model files (e.g., models/*.js, models.py, *.model.ts, app/models/*.rb)
- When indexing foreign keys or frequently queried fields
- When defining appropriate data types that match data requirements

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.
