name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with clear structure and minimal, helpful comments that explain complex logic without describing temporary changes or fixes. Use this skill when deciding whether to add comments to code, writing evergreen explanatory comments for complex sections, or preferring clear naming and structure over excessive commenting. Apply when working with any code file where comments might be needed to explain non-obvious logic, algorithms, or business rules.
